    "## **Section 1 - Introduction to Text Summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the task of generating a concise and coherent summary that captures the key information from a longer piece of text. As the volume of textual data continues to grow—from news articles and research papers to customer reviews and meeting transcripts—summarization plays an increasingly important role in helping people process and understand information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Extractive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization works by identifying and selecting the most important sentences or phrases from the original text. The summary is formed by piecing together these extracted parts without modifying the original wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "**Original text**:  \n",
    "> The mayor held a press conference today announcing new environmental initiatives to reduce air pollution in the city. The new policies include increased funding for public transportation and stricter emissions regulations for factories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Extractive summary**:  \n",
    "> The mayor announced new environmental initiatives. The policies include funding for public transportation and stricter emissions regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization goes a step further by generating new sentences that may not appear in the original text. It interprets and paraphrases the key ideas using natural language generation, similar to how a human might summarize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstractive summary**:  \n",
    "> The mayor introduced new plans to cut air pollution through transit funding and factory regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why This Lesson Focuses on Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "While extractive summarization is easier to implement and often performs well on factual documents, it has limitations:\n",
    "- It may copy irrelevant or redundant text.\n",
    "- It struggles to rephrase or synthesize ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization, powered by deep learning models like BART, T5, PEGASUS and LLMs, enables:\n",
    "- More fluent and human-like summaries.\n",
    "- Better generalization across different domains.\n",
    "- Control over the tone and length of the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because abstractive models are more aligned with how people summarize information—and because they demonstrate the strengths of modern language generation—we’ll focus on **abstractive summarization** in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we discuss the major models, inlcuding LLMs, used for summarization."

    "## **Section 2 - Overview of Popular Models for Abstractive Summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization tasks can be tackled using **specialized encoder-decoder models** like **BART, T5, and PEGASUS**, or **general-purpose decoder-only models (LLMs)** like **GPT-4o and LLaMA**.  Our textbook already introduced the models, so we won't go into detail here, rather we'll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Strengths of Specialized Summarization Models (BART, T5, PEGASUS)**\n",
    "1. **Architectural Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Encoder-decoder models process the entire input once with the encoder before generating the summary, making them *computationally efficient* for summarization.\n",
    "   - In contrast, decoder-only models must repeatedly attend to the entire input during generation, which is particularly costly for long inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tailored Training Objectives**\n",
    "   - These models are pre-trained specifically for text-to-text tasks.\n",
    "     - **BART:** Trained as a denoising autoencoder, making it robust to noisy or incomplete input.\n",
    "     - **T5:** Uses a “text-to-text” framework, making it versatile across various NLP tasks, including summarization.\n",
    "     - **PEGASUS:** Pre-trained to generate summaries by masking entire sentences during training, directly optimizing for abstractive summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alignment with Summarization Tasks**\n",
    "   - Fine-tuning on summarization datasets (e.g., CNN/Daily Mail, XSum) leads to **high-quality summaries** that are concise and relevant.\n",
    "   - Performance on benchmarks often surpasses general-purpose LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Better Control over Output**\n",
    "   - Easier to enforce structure, conciseness, or adherence to specific formatting requirements.\n",
    "   - Less prone to **hallucinations** or verbose outputs compared to general-purpose LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Domain-Specific Optimization**\n",
    "   - Fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on specialized datasets (e.g., medical or legal texts) produces highly accurate summaries with relevant terminology and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Weaknesses of Specialized Summarization Models**\n",
    "1. **Limited Generalization**\n",
    "   - Models like BART, T5, and PEGASUS require fine-tuning for specific summarization tasks.\n",
    "   - Struggle with novel domains or tasks without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Less Effective at Zero-Shot Summarization**\n",
    "   - General-purpose LLMs can perform reasonably well on summarization tasks without fine-tuning, which is challenging for encoder-decoder models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inflexibility**\n",
    "   - Encoder-decoder models are often designed for fixed inputs and outputs, making them less adaptable to creative or open-ended summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Strengths of LLMs for Summarization**\n",
    "1. **Generalization Across Tasks**\n",
    "   - Capable of summarization **without fine-tuning** through prompt engineering (e.g., “Summarize the following text...”).\n",
    "   - Strong performance across various domains with minimal adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning**\n",
    "   - Easily adaptable to new domains or styles through *in-context learning* (providing examples within the prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Versatility**\n",
    "   - Handles a wide range of tasks beyond summarization, making them highly flexible for mixed-use applications.\n",
    "   - Can switch between extractive, abstractive, or creative summarization depending on the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ease of Use**\n",
    "   - No need for specialized training or fine-tuning, making them immediately usable for various summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Weaknesses of LLMs for Summarization**\n",
    "1. **Inefficiency for Long Texts**\n",
    "   - Decoder-only models process the entire input text during every generation step, resulting in high computational costs for long documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prone to Hallucination**\n",
    "   - Without fine-tuning or careful prompting, LLMs can generate irrelevant or incorrect information, particularly for factual summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Less Structured Output**\n",
    "   - Outputs may be verbose or off-topic unless the prompt is carefully designed to enforce structure and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of Task-Specific Optimization**\n",
    "   - General-purpose LLMs may underperform compared to fine-tuned encoder-decoder models on specific summarization datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **State-of-the-art Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "As of April 2025, BART, T5, and PEGASUS remain state-of-the-art for many summarization tasks, especially when compute and data are limited, you need efficient fine-tuned models for specific domains, or you're doing sequence-to-sequence tasks where controllability and reproducibility matter.\n",

    "- **Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED)** or **LongT5** for long documents  \n",
    "- **LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Llama etc.) for few-shot or zero-shot summarization  \n",
    "- **HERA** (Hallucination Evaluation and Rewriting Architecture) for post-editing summaries to reduce factual errors  \n",

    "- Often require API access or substantial compute  \n",
    "- May not be easily reproducible or tunable for every use case  \n",

    "# Section 3 - Metrics for Evaluating Generated Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The book discusses two metrics, ROUGE and BLEU.  We introduced BERTScore last week in the text-generation lesson.  We'll use all three of these to evaluate our summarization results.  These metrics also apply to any text-generation task in which a reference text is available.  A fourth, and recently developed metric, is BARTScore and is specific to summarization tasks.  We'll introduce it here, but won't demonstrate it because it's a bit difficult to set up and not widely used yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating text generation is challenging because there are **many valid summaries** for a single input, and traditional metrics like ROUGE or BLEU only compare surface-level word overlaps. They often **miss meaning**, **penalize paraphrasing**, and **fail to detect factual errors or hallucinations**. Newer metrics like BERTScore and BARTScore help, but no single metric fully captures quality, faithfulness, and readability.\n",

    "Use an AI here to get more details as needed about n-gram, skip-bigram, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brief Introductions to the Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many others, but we'll focus on these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**\n",
    "   - Measures **n-gram, subsequence, or skip-bigram overlap** between a candidate and reference text.\n",
    "   - Commonly used for **extractive summarization** but also applied to **abstractive summarization**.\n",
    "   - Variants: **ROUGE-N (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2), ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence), ROUGE-S (Skip-bigrams)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**\n",
    "   - Measures **n-gram overlap** between a candidate text and one or more reference texts.\n",
    "   - Originally designed for **machine translation**, but adapted for **summarization**.\n",
    "   - Uses a **brevity penalty** to avoid favoring overly short outputs.\n",
    "   - Often reported with **1-gram to 4-gram precision scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BERTScore**\n",
    "   - Measures **semantic similarity** between candidate and reference texts using **contextual embeddings** from models like BERT.\n",
    "   - Matches tokens based on their **cosine similarity in embedding space**.\n",
    "   - Effective for **abstractive summarization**, especially when paraphrasing is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BARTScore**\n",
    "   - Uses **pretrained language models (e.g., BART)** to estimate the **likelihood of a summary given the source text** and vice versa.\n",
    "   - Evaluates summaries using **bidirectional scoring**: Coverage (`P(summary | source)`) and Faithfulness (`P(source | summary)`).\n",
    "   - Particularly useful for evaluating **fluency, coherence, and factual consistency**.\n",
