    "This notebook will help you configure Google Colab and get your files from CoCalc so that you can easily work on them in Colab.  The free tier of Colab gives access to T4 GPUs when they're available.  A $10/month subscription to Colab Pro gives longer access to T4 and better GPUs.  You can also buy additional compute credits as needed, but I hope you won't need any to finish the class.\n",

    "## Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You'll need a Google Account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One time only to make sure you have the Colab Notebooks Folder in your Google Drive.  \n",
    "  * Save a copy of this notebook in your Google Drive with File -> Save a copy in Drive.  This creates the Colab Notebooks folder in your Google Drive if you didn't already have it.  This is where your files will live while you're working in CoCalc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  In CoCalc follow these directions to create Homework_11.zip, Homework_12.zip.  You can do this on the Home Server in CoCalc.\n",
    "  * Go to Explorer -> Homework.  Check the box next to Homework 11.  Click Compress. Click \"Compress 1 Item\".\n",
    "  * Download this file to your local computer.\n",
    "  * Repeat for Homework 12 if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Now we're going to get those files into Google Drive:\n",
    "  * Open drive.google.com.  Go to My Drive / Colab Notebooks.  Drag Homework_11.zip to that folder.  \n",
    "  * Click the three dots to the right of the filename.  Choose Open With -> Zip Extractro and agree to the terms to unzip your Homework 11 folder.  \n",
    "  * You might have to refresh, but you should see Homwork 11 Folder now.\n",
    "  * Repeat the steps above for Homework 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Download your api_keys.env file from CoCalc and put it in your Colab Notebooks folder in Google Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Now you can double-click on your notebook in Google Drive to open it in Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can proceed to the setting up your homework notebooks, make sure that in Google Drive you have this file structure before proceeding to setting up your notebook:\n",
