    "Often we want to compare generated text to a reference text.  For example suppose we've prompted our text generation model and we expect it to generate the text `reference_text =  \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"` and it generates `generated_text = \"The fast crimson fox bounded over the sluggish brown hound.\"`.  Then we'd want to produce a high similarity score because the two texts say essentially the same thing.  However if the generated text were \"A slow green lizard leaps over a sleepy cat.\" we'd expect to get low similarity score.  For this exercise you're going to use a Gemini API-based model or a similar high-quality API-based model to build an `llm_score` function and then apply it to score text generated by a small local model.\n",
